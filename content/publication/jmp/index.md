abstract: "This paper analyzes the impact of minimum wages on firm entry, exit, and the margin of adjustment of surviving firms. I examine Costa Rica's setting, where minimum wages vary by occupations, levels are highly binding, and increases are sizeable and permanent. I assemble rich administrative data covering the universe of workers and firms to construct accurate measures of exposure to the policy. Then I implement difference-in-differences strategies that exploit the distinctive heterogeneity from the policy's structure to infer the responses and calculate minimum wage elasticities. Results suggest that the minimum wage substantially increased labor costs for exposed firms. Minimum wage exposure induces firms to reduce employment, while revenues, productivity, and capital-labor ratios increase. On the extensive margin, exposure to the minimum wage disproportionately hits low-productive units to exit the market, while it harms business creation, as industries with average exposure experience lower startup rates. Aggregate employment is 0.78 percent lower due to missing entrants."

abstract: "This paper analyzes the impact of minimum wages on firm entry, exit, and the margin of surviving firms' adjustment. I examine Costa Rica's setting, where minimum wages vary by occupations, levels are highly binding, and increases are sizeable and permanent. I assemble rich administrative data covering the universe of workers and firms in 2006-2017 to construct accurate exposure measures to the policy. Then, I show that minimum wages have a sizeable effect on aggregate employment through the adverse impact on firm entry. Results suggest that aggregate employment is, by the end of the analysis, 0.73 percent lower due to missing entrants and under the optic of a dynamic decomposition framework. Additionally, I provide new empirical evidence pointing out that exposure to the minimum wage disproportionately induces low-productive units to exit the market. Incumbent firms, on the other hand, experience a substantial increase in labor costs. Exposure to the minimum wage induces these units to reduce employment, while revenues, productivity, and capital-labor ratios increase. "

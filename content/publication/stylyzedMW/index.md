abstract: "This paper provides new evidence on the minimum wage impact on employment flows, using Costa Rica's distinctive occupation-based setting in which minimum wage adjustments are sizable and permanent. I construct firm-level minimum wage exposure measures and transition rates from administrative data from 2006-2017 to estimate short and longer-term responses to the policy. Results indicate that firms increase their pay premiums in compliance with the policy. However, higher minimum wages have a negative and persistent impact on hiring rates and induce a temporary increase in separation rates. Still, the policy helps firms to retain workers from moving to other firms. I propose a wage-posting model featuring worker and firm heterogeneity and endogenous job creation to rationalize the results."
